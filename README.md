This repo contains code for
Task 2: Image Segmentation and Crowd Density Estimator:
************************************
a. Find out how many people are there based on a set density based on the image
segmentation result.

The repo contains flask code.Run code in task2_code.ipynb to have flask interface.The code uses python,html,css files.Some example images are given in example_imgs folder

Task 3: Human Activity Recognition:
************************

a. As the name suggests, identify and recognize human activity from a video
source and classify it based on the activity thus performed.

The repo contains flask code.Run code in task3_code.ipynb to have flask interface.The code helps to download the data as well.The code uses python,html,css files

Task 4: Parameter Tuning
************************

a. Use a pretrained ResNet 18 and train on the CityScapes (see download page of
site for data) dataset for 15 epochs. Use discriminative learning and then
measure its effect on your model's performance.
